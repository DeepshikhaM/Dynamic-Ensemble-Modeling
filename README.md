# Dynamic-Ensemble-Modeling

## Dynamic Ensemble Model for Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project enhances traditional logistic regression for binary classification tasks by implementing a **dynamic ensemble model**. The approach addresses limitations such as **high variance, low accuracy, and feature noise**, ensuring **scalability, improved accuracy, and adaptability** to complex datasets.

## Implementation Details

- **Baseline Logistic Regression:** Implemented logistic regression using numerical programming libraries, achieving an initial accuracy of **75%**.
- **Two-Layer Ensemble Model:** Developed an ensemble model with **three logistic regression nodes**, improving accuracy to **82%**.
- **Three-Layer Ensemble Model:** Extended the architecture to **seven nodes**, further increasing accuracy to **88%**.
- **Scalability:** Designed the model to support an **arbitrary number of layers**, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to diverse datasets.
- **Variance Reduction:** Addressed high variance and low accuracy by **splitting datasets into subsets** and building ensemble models on each subset.
- **Feature Noise Reduction:** Introduced **probability diffusion across layers**, enhancing robustness against feature noise.
- **Performance Gains:** Demonstrated consistent accuracy improvements from **75% to 88%** across various classification tasks.
- **Generalization & Adaptability:** Provided a **scalable and generalized solution**, particularly effective for datasets with **clustering and feature variability**.

## Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Load and train the model using the following steps:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
X = df.drop("target", axis=1)
y = df["target"]

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Integrate Neural Networks:** Extend the ensemble approach to include **deep learning models**.
- **Real-time Adaptation:** Implement online learning for **dynamic model updates**.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Utilize techniques like **Bayesian Optimization and Grid Search** for parameter tuning.
